## Flutter Preparation Strategy
### 1. Core Flutter & Dart Fundamentals
Dart language basics

Async/await, Futures, Streams

Null safety

Generics and extensions

Flutter widgets

Stateless vs Stateful widgets

Layouts: Row, Column, Stack, Flex

Material vs Cupertino widgets

State management

Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, GetX

When to use which pattern

### 2. Architecture & Best Practices
Project structure

Separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data)

Clean architecture in Flutter

Dependency injection

GetIt, Riverpod

Navigation

Navigator 2.0, routing packages

### 3. Cross-Platform Considerations
Platform channels

Communicating between Flutter and native iOS/Android code

Integrating native SDKs

Using Swift/Objective-C with Flutter

Performance tuning

Widget rebuilds, avoiding unnecessary renders

Profiling with DevTools

### 4. Ecosystem & Tools
Popular packages

http, dio (networking)

hive, sqflite (local storage)

firebase (auth, analytics, push notifications)

Testing

Unit tests, widget tests, integration tests

CI/CD

Fastlane for iOS builds

Codemagic or GitHub Actions for Flutter pipelines

### 5. Interview Preparation
Coding rounds

Dart coding challenges (similar to Swift prep)

Flutter-specific rounds

Widget lifecycle

State management trade-offs

Handling platform-specific features

System design

Designing a cross-platform app (e.g., chat app, e-commerce app)

Behavioral

Highlight your ability to learn Flutter quickly and leverage iOS expertise

### 6. Positioning Yourself
Resume strategy

Present Flutter as an additional skill, not your primary one

Example: “13 years iOS experience, recently expanded into Flutter for cross-platform development”

Interview narrative

Emphasize your iOS mastery while showing adaptability with Flutter

Companies value senior engineers who can bridge native and cross-platform teams

📅 Suggested Timeline (Parallel with iOS Prep)
Weeks 1–2: Dart basics, Flutter widget tree, state management

Weeks 3–4: Architecture, navigation, platform channels

Weeks 5–6: Build 1–2 small apps (e.g., Todo app, weather app) to showcase

Weeks 7+: Practice interview questions, integrate Flutter into your portfolio

✅ Summary: With 6 months of Flutter, you don’t need to be an expert — but you should show solid fundamentals, ability to build apps, and awareness of architecture/performance. Combined with your iOS mastery, this positions you as a senior mobile engineer who can lead both native and cross-platform projects.

Would you like me to create a combined weekly study plan (iOS + Flutter) so you can balance preparation across both skill sets without overwhelming yourself?
