## Overview of the coding exercise:
You will be building an app from scratch. The app will perform common iOS app functions, like fetching data from the internet and showing it to the user. 
Our goal is to see your familiarity with the iOS SDK and get an idea of how you solve problems. We do not expect you to finish building an entire app in an hour – once we’ve seen your skills, we’ll take a little time to ask questions about your approach and then leave some time at the end for any additional questions you might have.

### Lets Split into smaller Tasks:
1. Creating new base project with ios capebilties.
2. Setting up network layer (Request, Response , Response parsing).
3. Error Handling network failures, bad data.
4. Creating UI in Swift UI , if required will try to add concurancy for smooth UI.
5. Unit Testing.
6. UI Testing.
7. If time allows documenting.
8. Adhare with SOLID Design Principle.
9. Check where we can utilize the oops principles.
