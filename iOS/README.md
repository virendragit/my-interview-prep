# Preparation Strategy for Senior iOS Developer Interviews
### 1. Core iOS & Swift Fundamentals
Swift language mastery

Advanced features: Generics, Protocol-Oriented Programming, Extensions, Property Wrappers

Memory management: ARC, retain cycles, weak/unowned references

Concurrency: GCD, OperationQueue, async/await, structured concurrency

UIKit & SwiftUI

Deep understanding of UIKit lifecycle

SwiftUI: declarative UI, state management, Combine integration

Objective-C Interoperability

Bridging headers, mixed projects, runtime features

### 2. Mobile Architecture & Design Patterns
MVC, MVVM, VIPER, Clean Architecture

Dependency Injection & modularization

Coordinators for navigation

SOLID principles applied to iOS projects

Testability and maintainability in large-scale apps

### 3. System Design & Scalability
At 13 years, you’ll be expected to design large-scale mobile systems:

App architecture for millions of users

Offline-first design

Syncing strategies (Core Data, Realm, SQLite)

Networking

REST, GraphQL, WebSockets

Caching, retry policies, error handling

Performance optimization

Instruments, profiling, memory leaks

Reducing app launch time

Security

Keychain, biometrics, secure storage

Encryption, SSL pinning

### 4. Cross-Functional Knowledge
CI/CD pipelines (Fastlane, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

App Store deployment (TestFlight, provisioning profiles, certificates)

Analytics & monitoring (Firebase, Crashlytics, New Relic)

Cross-platform awareness (Flutter, React Native — even if not expert, awareness helps)

### 5. Leadership & Senior-Level Expectations
Team management

Mentoring junior developers

Code reviews & setting coding standards

Collaboration

Working with product managers, designers, QA

Communication

Explaining technical trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders

Ownership

Driving features end-to-end

Handling ambiguity in requirements

### 6. Interview Preparation
Coding rounds

LeetCode-style problems (arrays, strings, trees, dynamic programming)

Focus on Swift implementations

iOS-specific rounds

App lifecycle, concurrency, architecture

System design rounds

Design a scalable chat app, video streaming app, or ride-hailing app

Behavioral rounds

STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

Leadership, conflict resolution, project delivery stories

### 7. Strategic Job Search
Target companies: Product-based firms (Microsoft, PayPal, Amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy, Byju’s, startups with strong mobile presence)

Networking: LinkedIn referrals, alumni connections

Resume: Highlight leadership, scalability, and impact (e.g., “Led iOS team of 6, scaling app to 10M users”)

Timeline: With focused prep, expect 2–4 months to land a role

Suggested Timeline
# Weeks 1–2: Refresh Swift, iOS fundamentals, concurrency

# Weeks 3–4: Deep dive into architecture, system design

# Weeks 5–6: Practice coding problems daily (LeetCode, HackerRank)

# Weeks 7–8: Mock interviews, behavioral prep, resume polishing

# Weeks 9+: Apply aggressively, leverage referrals, interview loop
