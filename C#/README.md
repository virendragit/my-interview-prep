How to Showcase Your C# / .NET Experience
1. Resume Positioning
Don’t list it as your primary skill (that’s iOS), but highlight it under “Additional Skills” or “Cross-Platform & Backend Experience.”

Example bullet points:

“Developed REST APIs in ASP.NET Core to support mobile applications.”

“Integrated C# backend services with iOS/Flutter apps for authentication and data sync.”

This shows you can bridge mobile and backend systems.

2. Preparation Topics
Since you’re aiming for senior roles, focus on breadth and integration rather than deep specialization:

C# Language

Async/await, LINQ, generics, delegates, events

Memory management, garbage collection

.NET Core / ASP.NET Core

Building REST APIs

Middleware, dependency injection

Entity Framework Core (ORM)

Architecture

Clean architecture in backend services

Microservices basics

Authentication/authorization (JWT, OAuth)

Integration

How mobile apps consume .NET APIs

Handling versioning, caching, and scalability

Cloud Awareness

Azure basics (App Services, Functions, Cosmos DB)

CI/CD pipelines for .NET apps

3. Interview Preparation
Technical rounds

Expect questions on API design, C# language features, and integration with mobile apps.

System design

Be ready to design a backend for a mobile app (e.g., chat service, e-commerce API).

Behavioral

Highlight adaptability: “I primarily worked in iOS, but when the team needed backend support, I contributed in .NET.”

4. Practical Showcasing
Build a small demo project:

A Flutter/iOS frontend consuming a .NET Core API.

Example: A Todo app with backend in ASP.NET Core + SQLite/Postgres.

Host it on GitHub — shows you can own end-to-end delivery.

5. Strategic Positioning in Interviews
Emphasize that your primary strength is iOS, but you’re comfortable with backend work in .NET.

This makes you valuable for mobile-first companies that need engineers who understand both client and server sides.

Use phrases like:

“I’m not a full-time backend engineer, but I can design and implement APIs in .NET when needed.”

“My strength is in mobile, but I bring backend knowledge that helps me collaborate better with server teams.”

📅 Suggested Add-On Timeline (Parallel with iOS + Flutter Prep)
Weeks 1–2: Refresh C# basics (async/await, LINQ, delegates)

Weeks 3–4: ASP.NET Core fundamentals (REST APIs, middleware, DI)

Weeks 5–6: Build a small demo project (mobile + .NET backend)

Weeks 7+: Practice system design with backend focus (scalable APIs, authentication, caching)

✅ Summary: Treat your C#/.NET experience as a secondary but valuable skill. Prepare enough to confidently discuss API design, integration, and backend architecture. Showcase it through a demo project and position yourself as a mobile engineer who understands backend systems — that’s a rare and powerful combination.

Would you like me to merge iOS + Flutter + .NET into one unified weekly plan so you can balance all three without stretching yourself too thin?
